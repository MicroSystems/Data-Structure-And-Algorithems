### Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm

The **Depth-First Search (DFS)** is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore nodes and edges of a graph. It starts at a given node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is commonly used for searching tree or graph data structures.

### How DFS Works

- DFS starts at a root node and explores each branch as deeply as possible before moving to the next branch.
- It uses a stack (either explicitly or via recursion) to keep track of the path and backtracks once a node has no unvisited neighbors.

### Steps in DFS

1. **Start at a node** (usually the root).
2. **Mark the node as visited**.
3. **Recursively visit all unvisited neighbors** of the current node.
4. **Backtrack** to previous nodes when no unvisited neighbors are left.
5. Continue until all nodes are visited or the search is complete.

### Example Graph

Consider the following graph represented as an adjacency list:

```
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B'],
    'F': ['C']
}

```

This graph can be visualized as:

```
    A
   / \\
  B   C
 / \\   \\
D   E   F

```

### Recursive DFS Example in Python

```python
def dfs(graph, start_node, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()  # Initialize visited set on the first call

    # Mark the current node as visited
    visited.add(start_node)
    print(start_node, end=" ")  # Process the current node (e.g., printing)

    # Recur for all the neighbors of the current node
    for neighbor in graph[start_node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)

# Example graph as an adjacency list
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B'],
    'F': ['C']
}

# Run DFS starting from node 'A'
dfs(graph, 'A')

```

### Output

```
A B D E C F

```

### Explanation:

1. Starting at `A`, DFS visits `B`, then `D`, and backtracks to visit `E`. After exhausting all neighbors of `B`, it moves to `C` and then `F`.
2. DFS explores as deep as possible before backtracking.

### DFS Using Stack (Iterative Approach)

Instead of recursion, we can implement DFS using an explicit stack.

```python
def dfs_iterative(graph, start_node):
    # Create a stack for DFS and initialize with the start_node
    stack = [start_node]

    # Set to keep track of visited nodes
    visited = set()

    # While there are nodes to explore
    while stack:
        # Pop the last node from the stack
        current_node = stack.pop()

        # If the node hasn't been visited
        if current_node not in visited:
            print(current_node, end=" ")  # Process the current node (printing it here)
            visited.add(current_node)

            # Add all unvisited neighbors to the stack
            for neighbor in graph[current_node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    stack.append(neighbor)

# Run DFS iteratively starting from node 'A'
dfs_iterative(graph, 'A')

```

### Output

```
A C F B E D

```

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges. DFS explores every vertex and edge once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for the recursion stack or explicit stack, and O(V) for the visited set.

### Applications of DFS:

- **Pathfinding**: Used to find a path between two nodes in a graph.
- **Topological Sorting**: DFS can be used to perform topological sorting in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- **Cycle Detection**: DFS helps detect cycles in both directed and undirected graphs.
- **Connected Components**: DFS can find all connected components in a graph.
- **Maze Solving**: DFS is used to explore all possible paths in a maze, often combined with backtracking.

**DFS in Python (using recursion):**

```python
def dfs(graph, start_node, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()  # Initialize visited set on first call

    # Mark the current node as visited
    visited.add(start_node)
    print(start_node, end=" ")  # Process the current node (printing it here)

    # Recur for all the neighbors of the current node
    for neighbor in graph[start_node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)

# Example graph as an adjacency list
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B'],
    'F': ['C']
}

# Run DFS starting from node 'A'
dfs(graph, 'A')

```

### Output:

```
A B D E C F

```

### Explanation:

1. **Graph Representation**: Like BFS, we represent the graph as an adjacency list. Each key in the `graph` dictionary corresponds to a node, and its value is a list of its neighboring nodes.
2. **Recursion**: The DFS function is recursive:
    - It starts at the `start_node`, marks it as visited, and processes it (in this case, it prints the node).
    - It then recursively explores each unvisited neighbor by calling itself (`dfs`) for each neighbor.
3. **Visited Set**: A `visited` set is passed as a parameter to keep track of nodes that have already been visited, preventing infinite loops (cycles).
4. **Traversal Process**:
    - Starting at node `A`, it explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking (this is the key feature of DFS).
    - The order of traversal might vary depending on how the neighbors are ordered in the adjacency list.

### DFS using an Explicit Stack (Iterative)

Hereâ€™s an **iterative** version using an explicit stack instead of recursion:

```python
def dfs_iterative(graph, start_node):
    # Create a stack for DFS and initialize with the start_node
    stack = [start_node]

    # Set to keep track of visited nodes
    visited = set()

    # While there are nodes to explore
    while stack:
        # Pop the last node from the stack
        current_node = stack.pop()

        # If the node hasn't been visited
        if current_node not in visited:
            print(current_node, end=" ")  # Process the current node (printing it here)
            visited.add(current_node)

            # Add all unvisited neighbors to the stack
            for neighbor in graph[current_node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    stack.append(neighbor)

# Run DFS iteratively starting from node 'A'
dfs_iterative(graph, 'A')

```

### Output:

```
A C F B E D

```

### Explanation of the Iterative Version:

1. **Stack**: DFS is typically implemented using recursion (which implicitly uses a stack), but here we explicitly use a list as a stack to avoid recursion.
2. **Traversal Process**:
    - Start by pushing the `start_node` onto the stack.
    - Pop the top node from the stack, process it, and push its unvisited neighbors onto the stack.
    - Continue this process until the stack is empty.

Both approaches (recursive and iterative) implement the same DFS algorithm but differ in how they handle the function calls.
